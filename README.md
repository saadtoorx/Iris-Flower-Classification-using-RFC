# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using RFC

Classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica using a Decision Tree Classifier trained on the classic Iris dataset.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This beginner-friendly machine learning project demonstrates how to classify iris flowers based on features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width using a **Decision Tree Classifier** from `scikit-learn`. The model is trained on the built-in **Iris dataset**, evaluated with key metrics, and visualized with a plotted decision tree.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📥 Load the Iris dataset using `scikit-learn`
* 🧪 Split data into training and testing sets
* 🌲 Train a Decision Tree classifier
* 📊 Evaluate model with accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
* 🌿 Visualize the confusion matrix using `seaborn`
* 🌳 Visualize the decision tree with `plot_tree()`
* 🖼️ Export and include visual outputs (confusion matrix, decision tree)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python 3.x  
* pandas  
* scikit-learn  
* matplotlib  
* seaborn
